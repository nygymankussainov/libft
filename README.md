# libft

	The libft project helped me to get a better understanding of how a lot of functions
	of popular C libraries work	"under the hood".
	This custom library will be used for many further projects.

Re-coded functions from such libraries like:

	string.h
	unistd.h
	stdlib.h
	sys/types.h
	sys/uio.h
	unistd.h
	fcntl.h
